# Hangman_Game
Hangman is a word game where the goal is simply to find the word.
You will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing all the missing letters you need to
find.
Use the keyboard to guess a letter (I recommend starting with vowels).
If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places in the answer where that letter appear will be
revealed.
After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the
remaining letters.
Be warned, every time you guess a letter wrong you lose a life out of five lives given.
